A Logging library that is a lightweight logger with basic features and easy to understand code. This logger has support for Info, Debug, Trace, Warning, Critical, and Error logging levels. It has three main features, these three main features are:
1) Saving logs to a file
2) Support for timestamps and an easy format
3) Support for coloured text

More features are coming soon!

## Building
Currenty, this logger only supports UNIX systems, primarily Linux, if you manage to port the, "Makefile" to MacOS, you could probably get this stuff up and going, I am working to port it to MacOS and Windows.
